# README

This theme is mostly Framer but has a touch of Ramda. I really like Framer but prefer pink to yellow and I also had trouble seeing a few things as my eyes aint all kinds of perfect no more.

Bettie is my dog and she was like, "Hey owner, name a theme after me.", and with that Bettie was born.

## Screenshots and stuff

They are coming but this first release is mostly to learn about publishing to the Microsoft.
